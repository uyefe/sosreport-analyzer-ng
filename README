2. sar-analyzer

  Presently, it gives -ZM option to usual sar-analyzer functionality.

  There are seven features.

  Show highest and lowest average value to a file with a report.
  Show spike, highest and lowest value to a file with a report.
  Show spike, highest and lowest value in given time-span to a file with a report.
  Show possible thrashing.
  Show network down.
  am-pm style is converted to abs style in the report.
  Generate graphs as postscript files.

  When the file sanity check fails, program stops echoing the reason.
  In that case, move the very file to other than <sosreport-dir>/var/log/sa and run the program again. 
  Or you may reading file including Japanese although machine locale is not JP.
  In that case, edit libsar-analyzer/Makefile.am to use common_jp.c and sar_analyzer_jp.c.

## Getting "sar file"

  Note that "sar file" should be basically, written in English or Japanese.

  It may be good to convert binary 'sa' file to text 'sar' file.
  Because, sometimes, text 'sar' file is not made yet but binary 'sa' file exists.
  Here is a way converting 'sa' file to 'sar' file.

  example:
  $ LC_ALL=C sar -f /var/log/sa/sa01 -A -t > ./sar01

  or in Japanese environment, just do this.

  $ sar -f /var/log/sa/sa01 -A -t > ./sar01

  how to remove ^@

  Sometimes, ^@ will appear in 'sar' file. In those cases, remove with this command.

  example:
  $ sed -i 's/\x00//g' ./sar01

  When you did above, check 'sar' file is written in Ascii text and clear.

  example:
  $less sar01

## Before using

  - sosreport

    Check /etc/sosreport-analyzer.conf

      You can set analyzing word for each analyzing member.
      If you are not sure, consult /usr/share/sosreport-analyzer/sosreport-analyzer.conf.example.
      New version will not override the conf file. When you build new version, be sure to copy file
      or at least, copy lines needed.

  - mcinfo 

    Check /etc/sosreport-analyzer-mcinfo.conf

      You can set analyzing word for each analyzing member.
      If you are not sure, consult /usr/share/sosreport-analyzer/sosreport-analyzer-mcinfo.conf.example.
      New version will not override the conf file. When you build new version, be sure to copy file
      or at least, copy lines needed.

## Usage

  - sosreport

    $ sosreport-analyzer -D <sosreport-dir>

      It writes a file to './sosreport-analyzer-results/<sosreport-dir>/<sosreport-dir>_<time>.txt',
      './sosreport-analyzer-results/<sosreport-dir>/<sosreport-dir>_sar_<time>.txt'.
      and, './sosreport-analyzer-results/<sosreport-dir>/graphs/<sosreport-dir>-<item>-<no>.ps'.

  - mcinfo

    $ sosreport-analyzer -M -D <mcinfo-dir>

      It writes a file to './sosreport-analyzer-results/<mcinfo-dir>/<mcinfo-dir>_<time>.txt',
      './sosreport-analyzer-results/<mcinfo-dir>/<mcinfo-dir>_sar_<time>.txt'.
      and, './sosreport-analyzer-results/<mcinfo-dir>/graphs/<mcinfo-dir>-<item>-<no>.ps'.

  - sar-only 

    $ sosreport-analyzer -S -D <sa-dir-path>

      It writes a file to './sosreport-analyzer-results/<dir>/<dir>_sar_<time>.txt'.
      and, './sosreport-analyzer-results/<dir>/graphs/<dir>-<item>-<no>.ps'.

  - time-span for sar 

    ex.

    $ sosreport-analyzer -T 09:00-13:00 -D <sosreport-dir> 
    $ sosreport-analyzer -T 09:00-13:00 -M -D <mcinfo-dir> 
    $ sosreport-analyzer -T 09:00-13:00 -S -D <sa-dir-path> 

  You can't redirect to a file.

## Is this program safe to execute?

  You can execute this program as an ordinary user not root ( you need to be root when editting conf file, though ).

  Creating directory unconditionally in the current directory for the analyzed files, with no harm.

  No memory leakage.

    Checked with 'valgrind --leak-check=full -v sosreport-analyzer -D <sosreport-dir>'. 

## Uninstall

  # make uninstall
