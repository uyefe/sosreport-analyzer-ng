## Getting "sar file"
  Note that "sar file" should be basically, written in English.

  It may be good to convert binary 'sa' file to text 'sar' file.
  Because, sometimes, text 'sar' file is not made yet but binary 'sa' file exists.
  Here is a way converting 'sa' file to 'sar' file.

  example:
  $ LC_ALL=C sar -f /var/log/sa/sa01 -A -t > ./sar01

  how to remove ^@

  Sometimes, ^@ will appear in 'sar' file. In those cases, remove with this command.

  example:
  $ sed -i 's/\x00//g' ./sar01

  Check 'sar' file is written in Ascii text and clear.

  example:
  $less sar01 | less

## Before using

  Check /etc/sosreport-analyzer.conf
  You can set analyzing word for each analyzing member.
  If you are not sure, consult /usr/share/sosreport-analyzer/sosreport-analyzer.conf.example.
  New version will not override the conf file. When you build new version, be sure to copy file
  or at least, copy lines needed.

## Usage

  $ sosreport-analyzer -D <sosreport-dir>

  It writes a file to './sosreport-analyzer-results/<sosreport-dir>/<sosreport-dir>_<time>.txt',
  './sosreport-analyzer-results/<sosreport-dir>/<sosreport-dir>_sar_<time>.txt'.
  and, './sosreport-analyzer-results/<sosreport-dir>/<sosreport-dir>-<item>-<no>.ps'.

  You can't redirect to a file.
