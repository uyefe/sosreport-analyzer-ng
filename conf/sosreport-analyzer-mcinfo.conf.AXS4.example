# 'all' echos every line in the file.
#
# Remember that 'all' should come very first. Other 'all' is omitted automatically.
# In some items, you can set any item-name, but string length shoul be between 2 to 10.
# Sometimes, certain files are not made by sosreport.
# In such cases, you can skip the file, setting item-name to 'skip'.
# But don't worry, sosreport-analyzer will automatically skips the directory which is not present.
# ex. lsb-release=skip
